# Mathematics in Quantitative Trading

The intersection of mathematics and finance has revolutionized how we approach trading in modern markets. From **stochastic calculus** to **machine learning**, mathematical models form the backbone of quantitative trading strategies.

## Key Mathematical Concepts

### Probability Theory

Understanding market movements through probabilistic models allows us to:

- Estimate risk-adjusted returns
- Model price distributions
- Calculate Value at Risk (VaR)

### Statistical Analysis

Statistical methods help identify patterns and relationships in market data:

```python
# Example: Calculating rolling correlation
correlation = returns_a.rolling(window=30).corr(returns_b)
```

### Linear Algebra

Matrix operations are fundamental for:

- Portfolio optimization
- Factor models
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

The beauty of quantitative trading lies in transforming abstract mathematical concepts into actionable trading strategies that can navigate the complexities of financial markets.
